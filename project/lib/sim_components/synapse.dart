// Short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) plasticity
// are both synaptic states that affect the strength of neuronal connections.
// Long/Short term plasticity (LTP/STP).

// ----STP ----
// ranges from milliseconds to minutes.
// STP is sometimes present in the CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus,
// where it decays into LTP. STP modulates the frequency response of synaptic
// transmission, while LTP preserves the fidelity.
// A temporary change in synaptic strength that lasts milliseconds to seconds.
// STP is a meta-stable state that decays exponentially and can be obscured
// by LTP. STP is involved in cognitive functions like speech recognition,
// working memory, and spatial orientation.

// ----LTP ----
// LTP ranges from 10s of minutes, hours, days or years.
// A stable change in synaptic strength that can last for hours, days, or even
// years. LTP is a cellular model of learning and memory that's generally
// related to the formation of long-term memory.

  // of an action potential, while IPSPs decrease it.
  // Magnitude: The magnitude of a PSP depends on the amount of neurotransmitter
  // released and the number of receptors on the membrane.
  //
  // Duration: PSPs have a transient duration of about 15â€“20 milliseconds.
  // Decay: PSPs decay with distance and time.
  // PSPs actually decrease or increase the probability that the postsynaptic
  // cell will generate an action potential.
  // PSPs are called excitatory (or EPSPs) if they increase the likelihood of
  // a postsynaptic action potential occurring, and inhibitory (or IPSPs) if
  // they decrease this likelihood.
